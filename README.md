# nitrogfx-py

nitrogfx-py is a Python library for handling Nintendo DS graphics formats. It can deserialize and serialize the formats and do some basic conversions with them.

Currently it supports:

- NCGR/NCBR tilesets
- NSCR tilemaps
- NCLR palettes
- NCER sprite data

The formats aren't perfectly implemented so this most likely won't work with every file from every game out there.

## Install from pip
